                Flowbite is an open-source library of interactive components
                built on top of Tailwind CSS including buttons, dropdowns,
                modals, navbars, and more.

                Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma
                software so everything you see in the library has a design
                equivalent in our Figma file.

              What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?

            <Accordion.Content>
              <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite
                are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a
                paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on
                smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers
                sections of pages.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite
                Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason
                stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
